# ToDoList
Stay productive through the use of this to-do list app that keeps track of what you need to do. Not only does it help you stay productive, but it also keeps you organized by sorting your tasks using a tag System. You can make your own tags or use the default tags like recurring. Once a task is completed simply tap on the task and it will fade out, pushing it to the bottom of the list.

This repository is the source code for my to do list app developed in android studio
